I recently came across an insightful article titled "10 Things Software Developers Should Learn About Learning" by Neil C.C. Brown. This article dives into cognitive psych and educational research to explore how devs can enhance their learning. It offers practical advice on topics like the human memory, the differeces between expert and novice thinking, and strategies for better knowledge retention. What I found most interesting was the discussions on the limitations of working memory and the idea of chunking info for deeper learning. The article also highlights the concept of a growth mindset, encouraging software engineers to view challenges as growth opportunities.

Really appreciate you highlighting this article! As someone who's grown up around educators (my parents are both in education), I found the connection between cognitive psychology and programming fascinating. The point about working memory limitations especially resonated - it explains why I sometimes feel overwhelmed when trying to learn multiple new frameworks at once. The spacing effect insight is also eye-opening - makes me want to restructure how I approach learning new technologies instead of doing those intensive weekend deep-dives. Thanks for sharing this perspective on learning as a skill itself!
